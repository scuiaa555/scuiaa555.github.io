### Basic notions

Probability space

$$(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$$

Random variable of $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$

$$
\begin{align*}
X: \Omega \rightarrow R \quad s.t.\\
X^{-1}(B)\in \mathcal{F}\quad \forall B\in \mathcal{B}.
\end{align*}
$$

Law of $X$: $\mu_X$

The law of random variable $X$ is a probability measure on $(R,\)
